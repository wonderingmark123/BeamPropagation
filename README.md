## Introduction
This program could visialize the beam propagation reflected by mirrors. The purpose of this software is to check how beam shape changes by reflection of mirrors. 

By inputing initial beam position, direction and shape, the program will initialize a beam. Adding the mirrors at different locations to change the beam propagation direction. 

## functions
There are 3 functions for ploting:

1. Sketch: plot the beam trace and mirror position briefly.
2. Detailed: form a 3D plot with beams' trace shape and mirror position.
3. Projected view: look at the beam through a indicated angle (You could change the angle by changing the View direction below) The projected image of the beam will show in the figure. The function could be used to check beam shape difference after multi-reflections.

## Usage
Open BeamPropagation.mlapp and run the program on matlab.
